                    <p class="intro">With the 4.1 cross-server custom match updates, players in the KIHC will be able to use bot commands in our Discord channel to queue with 7 other players. Once the queue is filled it will notify the players involved and they will start their own custom match with teams set by the bot.</p>
                    <p class="intro">The bot, using a proprietary MMR system, will match users according to our internal rankings to balance roles as evenly as possible. Once the match is complete, players will report the results to the bot and they’ll be able to enter into a new queue right after.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Rules of Vouching / What it means to Vouch</h2>
                    <div class="rules-content">When you vouch someone , you’re essentially introducing a new friend into your current group of friends. You’re telling everyone, “hey, guys, this is my new buddy, this person is cool I think they will fit in with everyone else.” Our hopes are the same as yours, and while there are no guarantees how people work with each other over the internet, here are our main points.</div>
                    <div class="rules-content">
                    	<ul>
	                    	<li>First, we very specifically are looking to add players who can handle wins, losses, and the other typical interactions of a competitive environment in a mature manner. Can a player keep a cool-head after a losing a close match where someone made a mistake? Are they able to be patient with other people when those guys might be learning new roles? That works for us and that’s what we want here. Or does a player flip out and start talking down to someone who didn’t understand any better, or harass them for their own peace of mind? That absolutely does not work for us.</li>
	                    	<li>Second, a player should have a reasonable expectation of how to play the game mode. As mentioned before, they don’t need to have thousands of hours of experience or any specific ranks or winrates, but they should know what they’re doing to a fair degree. We all want to have quality games and bringing in someone who is brand new would only make their gameplay experience far too difficult and likely unenjoyable. Everyone in the club wants to queue knowing they can count on their teammates to at least play decently. </li>
	                    	<li>Third, make entirely sure that player is who they say they are. Be familiar with them and what kind of person they are. Are they someone who will be fun for others to play with or will they be disruptive?</li>
                    	</ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rules-content embolden">So take care in whom you vouch. We see vouching as a privilege that you earn but also one that can be rescinded if players aren’t careful with it. So please be responsible with your vouches.</div>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Who is KIHC for? What level of experience do I need to play?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">There is no set rank, skill level, or winrate requirement to get in, but players must be decent to each other and to be willing to learn. Players must also have a fundamental understanding of how the the Feast game mode works (more specifically how to handle medals).</p>
                    </div><!--//item-->

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>I’m currently in another league. How will this affect me?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">It won’t. Again, this club is about you being able to join a queue at any time you wish. There are no schedules. We might host a scheduled night where we run an all-random mode or a draft mode, but other than that you queue at your own leisure.</p>
                    </div><!--//item-->
                    <div class="item">
                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>I’m worried about people being abusive either through chat or voice.</h3>
                        <p class="answer">That’s not what this club’s about or what we are going to allow. So if there’s an incident we halt that person’s queuing privileges the first time. The second time we handle things internally. Ideally what we want are for players to be able to act like functional adults and to police themselves when issues arise. Other than that our emphasis will be to protect our players. There is not going to be any berating of someone who isn’t as good as you. There is not going to be hostility to someone who lost you a game. There is not going to be talking down to others because they made mistakes. You engage and speak like adults or you move on. If you can’t act like one when things don’t go your way then the club isn’t for you. Abuse of any sort does not belong here.</p>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>I want to vouch someone or a friend wants me to vouch for them. What are the requirements for vouching?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">The main thing we ask of members is that you vouch people whom you know will be able to contribute positively to the club. That mostly means someone who won’t be toxic towards each other in and out of games, someone who has some viable experience and understands how Feast works on a fundamental level, and someone who is willing to work with others to help sustain positive gameplay experiences. But if you really wanna boil it down, basically you wanna vouch people who will be good to each other and who can do coin math (seriously don’t be vouching people who think 4 stacking is ok). They shouldn’t be brand new to pvp or Feast, but invites shouldn’t have to have thousands of games just to join.</p>

                        <p class="answer">In the future we plan to add an all random mode where players join the queue and are assigned random roles. Additionally we plan to add a draft feature where each team goes back and forth on picking jobs out of the overall pool until the teams are set. Otherwise, we will be working on new features constantly and we welcome any suggestions!</p>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>How do I apply? What else do I need to get in?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">As we are an invite-only club, any new applicants from Oct 10th forward will require two vouches from established members. Once an applicant gets those vouches they simply require group approval from the admins to make sure they aren’t on any excluded lists and they will be added to the roster. You do need Discord, at the very least. We will not require members to use a mic but we will encourage players to at least listen in during a match.</p>

                        <h3 class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>I have some difficult history with someone else who is in the club. How will this affect me?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">All we ask is that you try and work together when you play with each other, and to not antagonize each other when you’re out of the game. We’re not asking anyone to be best friends with someone you don’t want to be best friends with. We just want you to be able to play nice and act maturely with others. Everyone invited thus far is here under the pretense we can leave past issues at the door. Being drama free is a top priority for us.</p>

                        <p class="answer">The whole point of the voucher system is that you take responsibility for that player entering into the club. The person you vouch for represents your stake, as you yourself represent what the club is about. Of course you can’t control what someone says or does and it’s not your role to do that. So you vouch only when you’re sure that the person will be a good addition to our community. You vouch when you know that person is exactly who they say they are. Not everything works out all the time so if someone flames out then the persons vouching for them will have their vouching privileges restricted for a time.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Currently we are going to make leaderboards invisible. We will allow players to use bot commands that lets them privately see their winrates, MMR, and MMR per role. We might potentially release partial leaderboards at the end of each season but for the moment we just want the bot to accurately handle matchmaking. We want people to focus on playing and enjoying themselves whether it’s to get better on their favorite jobs or to try out new ones.</p>

                    <p>Some time ago, before Feast PvP existed, a small but dedicated group of us from Primal would try and queue nightly for Wolves’ Den PvP. We had players from Behemoth, Ultros, Leviathan, Excalibur, and several other servers all working together just to get games rolling on demand, and our nights would last for hours. As time went on it became more challenging to hold PvP nights, though the passion remained the same for many players. Since then, many players, including myself have been looking for ways to play quality games with respectable players the same way we did in the past.</p>
                    <p>With 4.1 here and the option for cross-server custom matches a now available feature we feel we can realize some of those ideals. With a bot that can automate intelligent matchmaking and a playerbase that cares about having those quality games, we feel that we can create a platform that encapsulates all of that. And that’s what KIHC is for.</p>
